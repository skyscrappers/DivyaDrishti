> _AI-Enhanced Learning and Interaction Assistant for Visually Impaired people at IIIT Delhi._

Our revolutionary idea in the educational domain to cater to the
needs of visually impaired students at IIIT Delhi by leveraging multiple facets of
Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing techniques to build a Large
Multi-Model (LMM) that will mitigate the challenges faced by them & bridging the
gap in their educational realm by providing them with highly tailored, context-
aware assistance system tailored to work in the college campus setting. This will
enable them to interact seamlessly with their peers and other objects within the
campus environment. Our model will be powered with facial recognition
techniques, deciphering complex scenarios in a localized environment and
delivering precise, actionable knowledge about the surroundings to turn daily
campus navigation and social encounters into a vivid experience. VisionPulse
uplifts the barrier of passive participation in classroom environments by
leveraging various techniques to extract audio from lecture recordings and to
create them into structured, accessible notes, which will further facilitate dynamic,
content-specific Q&A sessions using Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The
benefits of this technology ensure that no student feels alienated due to specific
barriers in their education by enhancing their class participation through
information retention techniques. Besides this, our project aims to provide the user
with more features like real-time obstacle detection, spatial location detection,
aiding in reading emails, reading, understanding, and conveying text-based
instructions in front of the user, enhancing the feasibility and easing the
individual's life. VisionPulse will be able to perform actions based on voice
commands and be capable of generating audio-based responses as well. Our
contribution of VisionPulse to the IIIT Delhi community can act as a gateway in the
realm of education for visually impaired students by creating a more inclusive,
empowering, and independent educational experience for them. Our project has the potential to become one of the breakthrough contributions in the academic
landscape which leverages existing tools and technology to a significant effect,
which will help bridge the gaps in education for differently-abled students and
create a healthy, inclusive environment where every student can thrive & unlock
their full potential to scale great heights & achieve all their dreams.
